## Git provider integrations

The following sections help you troubleshoot the integration of Codacy with your Git provider.

### GitHub Cloud and GitHub Enterprise authentication {: id="github"}

#### 404 error

While trying to authenticate on GitHub you get the following error message:

![Invalid client id](images/github-invalid-client-id.png)

This might mean that there is a mismatch in the Client ID that Codacy is using to authenticate on GitHub.

To solve this issue:

1.  Make sure that the value of `clientId` in your `values-production.yaml` file is the same as the Client ID of the [GitHub App that you created](../configuration/integrations/github-app-create.md)
2.  If the values were different, update your configuration and re-execute the `helm upgrade` command as described for [GitHub Cloud](../configuration/integrations/github-cloud.md) or [GitHub Enterprise](../configuration/integrations/github-enterprise.md)

If the error persists:

1.  Take note of the parameter `client_id` in the URL of the GitHub error page (for example, `Iv1.0000000000000000`)
2.  Check if the value of the parameter matches the value of the Client ID of your GitHub App

### GitLab Cloud and GitLab Enterprise authentication {: id="gitlab"}

#### Invalid redirect URI

While trying to authenticate on GitLab you get the following error message:

![Invalid redirect URI](images/gitlab-invalid-redirect-uri.png)

This might mean that the redirect URIs are not correct in the GitLab application that Codacy is using to authenticate on GitLab.

To solve this issue:

1.  Open the GitLab application that you created on [GitLab Cloud](../configuration/integrations/gitlab-cloud.md#create-application) or [GitLab Enterprise](../configuration/integrations/gitlab-enterprise.md#create-application)
2.  Make sure that all the redirect URIs have the correct protocol for the Codacy instance endpoints, either `http://` or `https://`
3.  Make sure that all the redirect URIs have the full path with the correct case, since the field is case-sensitive

If the error persists:

1.  Take note of the parameter `redirect_uri` in the URL of the GitLab error page (for example, `https%3A%2F%2Fcodacy.example.com%2Flogin%2FGitLab` or `https%3A%2F%2Fcodacy.example.com%2Flogin%2FGitLabEnterprise`)
2.  Decode the value of the parameter using a tool such as [urldecoder.com](https://www.urldecoder.org/) (for example, `https://codacy.example.com/login/GitLab` or `https://codacy.example.com/login/GitLabEnterprise`)
3.  Check if the decoded value matches one of the redirect URIs of your GitLab application

#### Unknown client

While trying to authenticate on GitLab you get the following error message:

![Invalid application id](images/gitlab-invalid-application-id.png)

This might mean that there is a mismatch in the Application ID that Codacy is using to authenticate on GitLab.

To solve this issue:

1.  Make sure that the value of `clientId` in your `values-production.yaml` file is the same as the Application ID of the [GitLab Cloud](../configuration/integrations/gitlab-cloud.md#create-application) or [GitLab Enterprise](../configuration/integrations/gitlab-enterprise.md#create-application) application that you created
2.  If the values were different, update your configuration and re-execute the `helm upgrade` command as described for [GitLab Cloud](../configuration/integrations/gitlab-cloud.md#configure) or [GitLab Enterprise](../configuration/integrations/gitlab-enterprise.md#configure)

If the error persists:

1.  Take note of the parameter `client_id` in the URL of the GitLab error page (for example, `cca35a2a1f9b9b516ac927d82947bd5149b0e57e922c9e5564ac092ea16a3ccd`)
2.  Check if the value of the parameter matches the value of the Application ID of your GitLab application

### Bitbucket Cloud authentication {: id="bitbucket-cloud"}

#### Invalid client_id

While trying to authenticate on Bitbucket Cloud you get the following error message:

![Invalid client_id](images/bitbucket-invalid-client-id.png)

This might mean that there is a mismatch in the OAuth consumer Client ID that Codacy is using to authenticate on Bitbucket Cloud.

To solve this issue:

1.  Make sure that the value of `key` in your `values-production.yaml` file is the same as the Key of the [Bitbucket OAuth consumer that you created](../configuration/integrations/bitbucket-cloud.md#create-oauth)
2.  If the values were different, update your configuration and re-execute the `helm upgrade` command as described for [Bitbucket Cloud](../configuration/integrations/bitbucket-cloud.md#configure)

If the error persists:

1.  Take note of the parameter `client_id` in the URL of the Bitbucket Cloud error page (for example, `r8QJDkkxj8unYfg4Bd`)
2.  Check if the value of the parameter matches the value of the Client ID of your Bitbucket OAuth consumer

## Codacy configuration

The following sections help you troubleshoot the Codacy configuration.

### Accessing the RabbitMQ dashboard

We use RabbitMQ for the internal message queue between our components.

If you need to access the RabbitMQ dashboard:

1.  Create a `port-forward` from the `rabbitmq` pod to your local machine, replacing `<namespace>` with the namespace in which Codacy was installed:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward codacy-rabbitmq-ha-0 15672:15672 --namespace=<namespace>
    ```

    !!! important
        **If you're using MicroK8s** use `microk8s.kubectl` instead of `kubectl`.

2.  Access the RabbitMQ dashboard on the address `localhost:15672`, and log in with the configured RabbitMQ credentials.

    The default RabbitMQ credentials are the following:

    -   **Username:** `rabbitmq-codacy`
    -   **Password:** `rabbitmq-codacy`
